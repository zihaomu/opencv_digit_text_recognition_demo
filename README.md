 Very easy demo, based on opencv dnn c++. Digital detector uses connected components. Since the pre-processing process is simple, the model is sensitive to light changes. It can achieve about 13FPS on my laptop.

 There are many things can be done to improve its performance, like using good image preprocessing or deep-learning-based digit detector.
